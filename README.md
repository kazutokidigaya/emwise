## What You Can Do

- **Easy Login & Secure Access:**

  - Log in effortlessly with preset credentials.
  - I have used React Context to keep track of user login, so only user can access the dashboard.

- **User Management Made Simple:**

  - Browse a paginated list of users directly from the Reqres API.
  - Quickly search, filter, edit, or delete users and get instant feedback.

- **A Clean, Modern Look:**

  - Enjoy a modern UI with Tailwind CSS.
  - I have used shadcn components for that modern feel.
